1.19 Vanilla Dr Jones Update Config & Vehicle Parts Files README

Comments to scalespeeder@gmail.com


To update your Dr Jones Trader to include 1.19 additions, if you have a completely vanilla (no other mods / additions) setup,
 simply upload the included TraderConfig.txt & TraderVehicleParts.txt files over the exisiting files inside your Servers Trader folder, which will be in
 your servers profiles / config / settings (it can have different names) folder. Save & Restart Server.
 
Thanks, Rob.
